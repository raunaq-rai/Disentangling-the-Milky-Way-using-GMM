\section{Introduction}

The Milky Way Galaxy, host to our solar system, is a spiral galaxy with a centre 
located approximately 150\,000\,trillion miles (or 25\,000 light\-years) from Earth. 
Its formation history is complex and remains an active area of research. Being embedded 
within the Milky Way means we can study it in greate detail than any external galaxy, 
testing models of galaxy formation with high-precision observational data. One of the 
central aims of Galactic Archaeology is to reconstruct the Milky Way’s assembly by 
examining the chemical compositions and dynamical properties of its stars.

In this project, we reproduce and extend the analysis of \citet{zhang2024existencemetalpoordiscmilky}, 
who investigated a very metal-poor disc component in the Milky Way. Very metal poor 
stars, formed from an interstellar medium unpolluted by earlier generations of 
supernovae, are among the oldest relics in the Galaxy. Discovering them on disc-like 
orbits would challenge the conventional view that the disc formed later from already 
enriched gas \citep{BlandHawthorn2016}, implying instead an earlier onset of disc 
assembly. Using Gaia DR3, the study by \citet{zhang2024existencemetalpoordiscmilky} 
applied a Gaussian Mixture Model with Extreme Deconvolution to the velocity 
distributions of stars across metallicity bins, probing whether a coherent disc signal 
persists down to the lowest metallicities.

\subsection{Components of the Milky Way}

The Milky Way is commonly decomposed into four stellar components: a \emph{thin disc}, 
a \emph{thick disc}, a central \emph{bulge/bar}, and a roughly spherical \emph{halo} 
\citep{BlandHawthorn2016,Helmi2020}.  
The thin disc describes the majority of stars and most of the interstellar gas 
in the galaxy.  Ongoing star formation is concentrated in the “molecular–gas ring’’ where young, 
metal-rich stars trace nearly circular, co-rotating 
orbits with low velocity dispersion ($\sigma_\phi \simeq 20\;\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$).  
Above the mid-plane lies the thick disc: an older ($\gtrsim8$–$10\;\mathrm{Gyr}$), 
moderately metal-poor population , a scale 
height of $z_{\mathrm{scale}}\approx1\;\mathrm{kpc}$, and hotter kinematics 
($\sigma_z \simeq 40\;\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$) while still retaining net prograde rotation.  
Inside $R\lesssim2\;\mathrm{kpc}$, the central bulge—partly bar-shaped—hosts both 
old, metal-rich stars and a younger, actively forming component; stellar motions 
there combine bar-driven streaming with high random velocities 
($\sigma\sim100\;\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$).  
Encasing all of these is the stellar halo, which contributes only a few per cent 
of the total stellar mass yet includes the Galaxy’s oldest, most metal-poor stars 
($[\mathrm{Fe/H}]\lesssim-1.5$) on highly eccentric or even retrograde orbits.  
Its low density, rich substructure, and kinematics indicate an origin in the
 hierarchical accretion and tidal disruption of dwarf galaxies and globular clusters.  
Together, the spatial distribution, chemistry, and dynamics of these four components 
include clues to the Milky Way’s star-formation history and its sequence of merger events.


\subsection{Metallicity as a Cosmic Clock}

Precise ages for individual old stars are difficult to measure, so their chemical 
composition - most commonly the iron-to-hydrogen ratio, $[\mathrm{Fe/H}]$ - is 
used as a surrogate clock.  
Very metal-poor (VMP) stars must have formed before successive generations of Type II 
and Type Ia supernovae had substantially enriched the interstellar medium, and 
therefore have low $[\mathrm{Fe/H}]$ values.  
Metallicity is inferred spectroscopically by measuring the equivalent widths of 
metal absorption lines, particularly Fe\,\textsc{i} and the Ca\,\textsc{ii} H and 
K lines at 396.8\,nm and 393.4\,nm, respectively. After correcting for stellar 
effective temperature and surface gravity, the relative strengths of these lines 
yield elemental abundances \citep{Gray_2005}.
Large surveys (for example APOGEE, GALAH, LAMOST, and the Gaia XP spectra) now 
provide such measurements for millions of stars, enabling empirical age–metallicity 
relations that link chemistry to stellar chronometry 
\citep[e.g.][]{Nordstrom2004,Haywood2013,leung2019deep,Anders2023}.  
These studies consistently show that stars with $[\mathrm{Fe/H}]\lesssim -1$ are 
typically older than $\sim10$\,Gyr, making low-metallicity populations valuable 
probes of the Milky Way’s earliest disc-building epochs.


%------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{$\Lambda$CDM\, Model}
\label{subsec:LCDM_halo}

In the concordance $\Lambda$CDM model, galaxy-sized haloes assemble hierarchically:  
small dark-matter clumps form first and then merge to build larger structures.  
Cosmological $N$-body simulations show that the number of subhaloes of mass $M$ follows  
$\mathrm{d}n/\mathrm{d}M \propto M^{-1.9}$.  
For a Milky-Way–sized halo, this implies that over the $\sim$14\,Gyr lifetime of the Universe
(i.e.\ a Hubble time), the halo experiences:
\begin{itemize}
    \item ${\sim}10^{2}$ \textbf{minor} accretion events with $M_{\rm sub}\lesssim10^{9}\,M_\odot$, and 
    \item a few \textbf{major} mergers with $M_{\rm sub}\gtrsim10^{10}\,M_\odot$.
\end{itemize}
  

Only a small fraction of dark-matter haloes form significant numbers of stars.  
Below a critical virial mass of $M_{\rm vir}\!\sim\!10^{11}\,M_\odot$, reionisation and stellar feedback 
strongly suppress the efficiency of star formation.  
As a result, the stellar-mass–halo-mass (SMHM) relation becomes steep at the low-mass end 
\citep{Purcell2007,BullockBoylanKolchin2017}:  
most low-mass subhaloes remain effectively ``dark'', while only a few relatively massive dwarfs 
produce observable stellar populations.

Thus, although the Milky Way has accreted hundreds of subhaloes over its history,  
just one or two of the most massive dwarf galaxies contribute the bulk of the stellar halo’s mass;  
the rest contribute primarily dark matter and dynamical substructure.

After accretion, dynamical friction causes the most massive satellites to sink deep into the Galactic potential.  
Their orbits become increasingly radial, and their stellar debris is dispersed throughout the inner halo.  
This debris retains coherent signatures—strong radial anisotropy, distinctive angular momenta,  
and chemically narrow abundance sequences \citep[e.g.][]{HelmiDeZeeuw2000}.  
As a result, the stellar halo is not a smooth, featureless spheroid but a fossil record of the Galaxy’s 
merger history: its inner regions are shaped predominantly by a few massive accretions 
(e.g.\ Gaia-Sausage/Enceladus), while the outer halo reflects contributions from many lower-mass mergers.

%------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Accretion versus {\it in-situ} disc formation}
\label{subsec:accretion_vs_insitu}

Chemical and kinematic evidence confirms that the metal-poor halo 
is primarily accreted.  The debris of the Gaia–Sausage/Enceladus (GSE) event, for instance, 
is traced by stars with $-2\!<\![\mathrm{Fe/H}]\!<\!-1$ and extreme orbital anisotropy 
($\beta\!\gtrsim\!0.8$; \citealt{Belokurov2018,Helmi2018}).  
At $[\mathrm{Fe/H}]\!\lesssim\!-2$ an even broader mix of minor mergers emerges, 
erasing any global rotation signal \citep{Lancaster2019,Bird2021}.  

Against this backdrop, a number of studies have uncovered stars in the range 
$-2\!<\![\mathrm{Fe/H}]\!<\!-1$ whose velocities resemble a disc:  
modest eccentricities and net prograde rotation 
\citep{Norris1985,Chiba2000,Carollo2019,An2020}.  
Gaia has pushed this frontier to $[\mathrm{Fe/H}]\!<\!-2$  
\citep{Sestito2019,Venn2020,Cordoni2020,Mardini2022}.  
Whether these objects represent (i) an {\it in-situ} metal-poor disc or (ii) the spun-up debris of  
earlier mergers remains hotly debated.

%------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Origins of very-metal-poor disc candidates}
\label{subsec:origins_VMP_disc}

Three broad formation scenarios have been proposed:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Early {\it in-situ} disc.}  
          Stars form in a gas-rich disc before $z\!\sim\!4$, and later migrate outward 
          or are dynamically heated; such stars would share the chemistry of the proto-Galaxy. 
    \item \textbf{Proto-galactic building blocks.}  
          VMP stars originate in several massive, gas-rich satellites accreted at high redshift;  
          their debris is dragged into the disc plane as the gaseous disc settles 
          \citep[e.g.][]{Sestito2020}. 
    \item \textbf{Late, minor prograde mergers.}  
          Low-mass satellites on aligned orbits are assimilated after the disc forms,  
          depositing a thin layer of metal-poor stars that retain disc-like kinematics 
          \citep{Santistevan2021}.
\end{enumerate}
Cosmological simulations generally reproduce scenario\;2,  
finding that early mergers dominate the VMP budget while a coherent disc does not appear  
until $z\!\lesssim\!2$ \citep{Gurvich2023}.  

Observationally, \citet{Belokurov2022} identified \textit{Aurora}, a kinematically hot, weakly rotating  
population with $-2\!\lesssim\![\mathrm{Fe/H}]\!\lesssim\!-1.3$, arguing against an extremely early disc.  
Follow-up work shows Aurora to be centrally concentrated \citep{Rix2022,Arentsen2020,Arentsen2020a}, 
consistent with heated debris rather than a long-lived thin disc.  
Furthermore, secular processes such as bar–halo resonances can impart a modest prograde bias to halo stars, 
mimicking a disc signal \citep{Dillamore2023}.  

\subsection{This Work}

By reproducing the work by \citet{zhang2024existencemetalpoordiscmilky}, this study assesses 
the claim that the Milky Way hosts a very-metal-poor 
(VMP; $[\mathrm{Fe/H}]<-2$) stellar disc . 
Using the catalogue from \citet{Andrae2023}, data set is drawn from Gaia DR3, 
which supplies six–dimensional phase–space coordinates—sky position, parallax–based distance, 
proper motions, and radial velocity—for each star, together with homogeneous metallicity and 
$\alpha$-element abundances from the Gaia XP pipeline.  To disentangle kinematic 
sub-populations we model the full three-dimensional 
velocity distribution $(v_R,v_\phi,v_z)$ with a Gaussian Mixture Model,in successive narrow metallicity bins, whose parameters are inferred 
via Extreme Deconvolution (XD). The XD formalism explicitly folds the individual distance and 
proper-motion uncertainties into the likelihood, ensuring that measurement noise does not bias 
the recovered velocity values.

Astrophysically, a genuine disc should manifest itself as a high-weight Gaussian centred near the Local 
Standard of Rest ($v_\phi\simeq220\;\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$) with small tangential and vertical dispersions 
($\sigma_\phi,\sigma_z\lesssim30\;\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$) and negligible mean radial motion, whereas the 
halo or any heated component should appear as a broad, almost isotropic Gaussian with little net rotation 
and dispersions of order $120$–$150\;\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$.  By tracking how the weight of the cold, 
rotating component varies with metallicity we can determine when ordered rotation first emerged and 
test whether VMP stars were formed in situ or accreted from a satellite.

\section{Data}
\label{sec:data}

\subsection{Sample construction}\label{subsec:data_sample}

Our catalogue is the bright ($G<16$) red–giant–branch sample of \citet{Andrae2023}.  
Stellar metallicities are predicted with an Extreme Gradient Boosting model 
trained on high-resolution \textsc{APOGEE}~DR17 spectra and a supplementary 
set of very metal-poor stars, ensuring reliable performance down to 
$[\mathrm{M/H}]\simeq-3.5$.  
For each of the 17.6\,million giants the catalogue contains values of 
$[\mathrm{M/H}]$, $T_{\mathrm{eff}}$, and $\log g$ with a random uncertainty 
of $\simeq0.1$\,dex in $[\mathrm{M/H}]$ at $G\!\lesssim\!15$.  
The catalogue only retains entries flagged as “high-confidence’’ and lying 
in $-3.5<[\mathrm{M/H}]<+0.5$.

Astrometric positions, proper motions, and radial velocities come from the main 
\textit{Gaia}~DR3 tables \citep{GaiaCollaboration2023}, while heliocentric 
distances are adopted from the Bayesian photo-geometric catalogue of 
\citet{BailerJones2021}.  
Because accurate velocities scale with distance precision, we impose a 
fractional-parallax-uncertainty cut $\sigma_{\varpi}/\varpi<0.10$ 
(\textsc{fpu}); stars that fail this threshold are discarded.

XP spectra are susceptible to reddening: heavy extinction dims the sources, 
lowers the XP signal-to-noise ratio, and biases the machine-learning metallicities.  
As in described \citet{zhang2024existencemetalpoordiscmilky}, to minimise 
such systematics, stars with $E(B{-}V)_{\mathrm{SFD}}>0.5$ or Galactic latitude 
$|b|<10^{\circ}$ were excluded. Colour-excess values from the SFD map accessed 
via dustmaps \citep{Green2018} was used for this.  
These criteria remove regions where dust corrections are large and spatially 
variable, at the expense of a loss of sky coverage losing a large number of stars 
at low galactic latitudes.

Field-star kinematics can also be skewed by dense sub-structures.  
Accordingly, following \citet{zhang2024existencemetalpoordiscmilky}, we remove 
all objects lying within $1^{\circ}$ of any known globular cluster or 
dwarf-galaxy satellite using the list and data of these compiled by 
\citet{Pace2024}.  
This step removes obvious non-field populations (e.g.\ cluster members and 
recent accretion debris) without significantly reducing the statistical power 
of the sample.

After the metallicity flag, distance–quality, reddening, latitude, and 
sub-structure cuts, our working data set comprises $\sim3.4\times10^{6}$ 
red-giant stars possessing homogeneous metallicities and six-dimensional 
phase-space information.

\subsection{Galactocentric Positions and Velocities}
\label{subsec:velocities}

Six–dimensional phase–space coordinates are obtained with
astropy.coordinates.  We adopt a Galactocentric frame
with $R_{0}=8.1$\,kpc and $Z_{0}=25$\,pc \citep{McMillan2016}, and a solar
velocity\footnote{Cartesian components $(U,V,W)$, where $U$ is radially
outwards, $V$ is aligned with Galactic rotation, and $W$ points to the
North Galactic Pole.}
$(U_{\odot},V_{\odot},W_{\odot})=(11.1,\,245,\,7.25)$\,km\,s$^{-1}$
\citep{Schonrich2010}.
The cylindrical velocity components
$(v_{R},v_{\phi},v_{Z})$ are extracted from the transformed
SkyCoord module.

To propagate measurement errors we generate
$N_{\rm MC}=100$ Monte–Carlo realisations per star, drawing
parallax, proper motions, radial velocity, and distance from their
reported uncertainties (the proper–motion covariance is honoured
through a bivariate normal).  Each realisation is transformed to the
Galactocentric frame, yielding distributions of
$v_{R}$, $v_{\phi}$, and $v_{Z}$; the $1\sigma$ widths of those
distributions are stored as per–star velocity uncertainties.




\begin{figure}

           dust, and quality cuts.  Greyscale pixels show the normalised
           counts in each metallicity bin; the red dashed curve is the
           median $v_{\phi}$, and the black curves trace the 16$^{\text{th}}$
           and 84$^{\text{th}}$ percentiles.
           (A reproduction of Figure 2 from \citet{zhang2024existencemetalpoordiscmilky})}
  \label{fig:vphi_tracks}
\end{figure}



As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:vphi_tracks}, stellar azimuthal velocities
evolve increase with metallicity.  Halo–like kinematics dominate at
${\rm [M/H]}\lesssim-1.5$ with statstics
indicative of a pressure-supported component.  A rapid spin-up appears over the 
metallicity range ${\rm [M/H]} \simeq -1.3$ to $-0.9$, consistent with \citet{Belokurov2022}.
By ${\rm [M/H]}\gtrsim-0.5$ the stellar azimuthal velocities reaches the Local
Standard-of-Rest value ($\approx220\;\mathrm{km\;s^{-1}}$) and the
velocity dispersion dispersion falls, marking the
transition to a disc.  Visually, using \ref{fig:vphi_tracks}, we can observe
that the onset of ordered rotation in the Milky Way occurred when the inter-stellar medium
reached roughly one-tenth solar metallicity.

           directions—signalling lower velocity dispersion—while the bulk
           of stars moves upward to larger prograde azimuthal velocity.

           in Fig.~\ref{fig:vRvphi_bins}.
           }
  \label{fig:ref_ellipses}
\end{figure}

As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:vRvphi_bins}, stars with
${\rm[M/H]}\!\geq\!-1.0$ have a strong prograde bias in azimuthal velocities, 
with a peak at $v_\phi\!\gtrsim\!180$ km s$^{-1}$ and a relatively narrow
distribution in $v_R$. As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:ref_ellipses}, this is consistent with 
the thin– and thick-disc ellipses. 
Below ${\rm[M/H]}\simeq-1.0$ the distribution broadens and
drops toward $v_\phi\!\approx\!0$, indicating
pressure supported kinematics, characteristic of the stellar halo and
the radial Gaia–Sausage/Enceladus debris.  At the lowest
metallicities (${\rm[M/H]}\lesssim-1.5$) the contours are nearly
isotropic with only a mild prograde bias.  Hence, any
rotation-supported very-metal-poor disc must contribute at most a
small fraction of the population. In subsequent analysis we quantitatively assess
these observations.

Given we are testing whether a very-metal-poor stellar disc exists, we naturally 
restrict the sample to stars within \mbox{$|Z|<2.5$ kpc} of the galactic mid-plane. 
This keeps the focus on stars close to the plane, where any disc-like population 
(whether formed in situ or deposited by mergers) would be found \citep{Tkachenko_2025}.

Upon comparison with \citet{zhang2024existencemetalpoordiscmilky}, we note that our 
sample is approximately the same size - with a difference of less than 0.002\% of the sample size in each bin.



\section{Methodology}

\subsection{Gaussian Mixture Model}

To quantitatively investigate the kinematic structure of metal-poor stars and assess 
the presence of a potential very-metal-poor disc, we use a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) framework
 as done by \citet{zhang2024existencemetalpoordiscmilky}. 
GMMs are a class of unsupervised machine learning algorithms commonly used in data science 
for clustering and density estimation. They model a dataset as a weighted sum of multivariate 
Gaussian distributions, each corresponding to a latent sub-population within the data.

From a probabilistic perspective, the GMM assumes that each observed data point is generated from a 
hidden (latent) variable indicating membership in one of the Gaussian components. This latent space 
formulation allows the model to assign probabilistic classifications to data points, providing a 
soft clustering where each star has a fractional likelihood of belonging to each component. In our case, 
the data are three-dimensional velocity vectors $(v_R, v_\phi, v_Z)$, and the latent space captures 
distinct kinematic substructures in this space.

We implement the GMM fitting using the pyGMMis package \citep{pygmmis} in the $v_R$, $v_\phi$, and $v_Z$
phase space. This algorithm extends the standard 
Expectation-Maximisation (EM) algorithm with the ``Extreme Deconvolution'' technique developed by 
\citet{Bovy2011}. This method is particularly well-suited to astronomical datasets, as it incorporates 
measurement uncertainties into the GMM fitting by modifying the EM updates to account for known errors 
on each data point. In our case, these uncertainties are derived from the Gaia astrometric and 
spectroscopic data and are represented by diagonal covariance matrices encoding the squared uncertainties 
in $v_R$, $v_\phi$, and $v_Z$ for each star.


\subsection{Number of Gaussian Components}
\label{subsec:n_components}

We apply the GMM separately to each metallicity bin with ${\rm [M/H]} < -1$, as we are specifically 
interested in detecting any rotationally supported structure among the very metal-poor stars. An important decision 
must be made when implementing the appropriate number of components in applying Gaussian Mixture Models. Too few 
components may underfit the data, missing real substructures, while too many will overfit, leading to spurious 
and physically uninterpretable results.

We select the optimal number of components using the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) \citealt{Schwarz1978}. 
The BIC is defined as

\begin{equation}
\mathrm{BIC} = k \ln(n) - 2 \ln \mathcal{L},
\end{equation}

where $k = (1 + 3 + 6) \times N - 1$ is the total number of free parameters in a model with $N$ Gaussian components 
(accounting for the weights, means, and covariances), $n$ is the number of stars in the sample, and $\mathcal{L}$ 
is the maximum likelihood of the fit. The BIC penalizes model complexity, such that adding extra components 
without a significant gain in likelihood will result in a higher BIC value.

\end{figure*}


The Expectation-Maximisation algorithm can become trapped in local minima, so we performed 50 initialisations 
for each $N$ and recorded the BIC value for each trial. The minimum BIC value across all trials indicated 
the statistically preferred model and suggests that the global optimum was likely reached. 

To improve convergence and model stability, the GMM components in each trial were initialised using the kmeans algorithm. 
This is is due to the sensitivity of GMMs to their starting conditions: poor initialisation can lead to convergence 
on undesirable solutions, particularly in high-dimensional or overlapping data. KMeans clustering provides an
initialisation point by partitioning the velocity space into compact, roughly spherical clusters. This works well with the 
assumptions of Gaussian components and often gives faster, more stable convergence and more physically meaningful results. 
In our application, where stellar substructures are partially overlapping in velocity space, this method applies well.

In Figure~\ref{fig:bic_vs_n_components}, we show the distribution of BIC values across four metallicity bins as
a function of $N$. The resulting preferred number of components are 2, 4, 5, and 5 for the VMP, IMP, MP1, and MP2 bins.
This is in agreement with the findings of \citet{zhang2024existencemetalpoordiscmilky}.
Our analysis, however, selects the lowest BIC each time, removing the need for a subjective choice of the number of components
when BIC values are very similar. \citet{zhang2024existencemetalpoordiscmilky}, when observing the BIC values for the MP1 bin 
chooses to use 5 components instead of 6 despite the BIC score for the 6-component model being lower than the 5-component model.

\subsection{Gaussian Mixture Model Fit}
\label{subsec:gmm}

Using the number of components selected by the BIC criteria, we fit the GMM to the data in each metallicity bin as shown in 
Figure~\ref{fig:gmm_decompositions}. We increased the number of initialisations to 100 for the final fitting to ensure convergence to a
stable solution.

\end{figure*}

As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:gmm_decompositions}, the GMM is able to capture kinematic substructures in the velocity space 
of metal-poor stars. As metalicity increases, a gaussian component with a clear prograde rotation signal emerges (in green),
indiciative of a disc-like structure. The statistics of the GMM fit are summarised in Table~\ref{tab:gmm_parameters},
which lists the weights, means, and dispersions of each component in the four metallicity bins.

At $\mathrm{[M/H]} < -1.6$ (the VMP and IMP regimes), a disc component is not observed. Instead, the kinematic structure 
is dominated by a prograde halo and a stationary halo. In the VMP bin, the sample is almost evenly split between these 
two components, with the stationary halo contributing 51.1\% and the prograde halo 48.9\%. Both show broad velocity 
dispersions, with only modest rotational support ($\overline{v_\phi} \sim 69$ km\,s$^{-1}$ for the prograde halo) 
and no evidence for a kinematically cold disc-like structure.

In the IMP bin, the picture remains qualitatively similar, although the prograde halo dominates more strongly 
(63.3\%) and additional substructure becomes apparent. Two minor components, interpreted as fragments of the 
Gaia–Sausage/Enceladus (GS/E) merger debris, are also identified, each contributing $\sim$7\% of the population 
and exhibiting highly radial orbits ($|v_R| > 200$ km\,s$^{-1}$). These GS/E components are characterised by 
strong anisotropy and contribute to the broadening of the halo distribution, but again show no signature of 
disc-like kinematics. The absence of a cold, rotating disc in these bins suggests that if a very-metal-poor 
disc exists, it must be a minor contributor to the local stellar population.

Our GMM decomposition recovers the same substructures identified by \citet{zhang2024existencemetalpoordiscmilky} 
across all metallicity bins. We find similar velocity dispersions and centroid trends for the stationary halo, 
prograde halo, and GS/E components. Notably, our model assigns a more comparable weight to the 
prograde halo component in the VMP bin, in contrast to the dominant stationary 
halo reported by \citet{zhang2024existencemetalpoordiscmilky}. We also observe some variation 
in the centroid $v_\phi$ values of GS/E substructures, although their bimodal spatial structure is preserved.

\subsection{Rotational Support and the Onset of Disc Formation}

To assess the degree of rotational support in each component, we compute the ratio 
$V_{\rm rot} / \sigma_\phi$, where $V_{\rm rot}$ is the mean azimuthal velocity and 
$\sigma_\phi$ its dispersion. This ratio serves as a conventional diagnostic of disc-like 
kinematics, with values $\gtrsim 3$ indicating rotation-supported populations. As shown in 
Figure~\ref{fig:v_over_sigma}, all components in the VMP and IMP bins fall below this threshold, 
confirming that the GMM identifies only dynamically hot, dispersion-supported structures in these 
regimes. This is consistent with the interpretation of the dominant components as stationary and 
prograde halo populations, with $V_{\rm rot} / \sigma_\phi \approx 0.7$ in both cases (see also 
Table~\ref{tab:gmm_parameters}).

At higher metallicities, a dynamically colder disc population emerges. In the MP1 bin, the thick 
disc component (green) rotates at $v_\phi \sim 160$ km\,s$^{-1}$ with $\sigma_\phi \sim 57$ km\,s$^{-1}$, 
yielding $V_{\rm rot} / \sigma_\phi \approx 2.8$. While just below the canonical boundary, this 
component’s low vertical dispersion and substantial weight (22.1\%) mark it as a distinct disc-like 
structure. By the MP2 bin, the disc becomes the dominant component (37.4\%), with 
$V_{\rm rot} / \sigma_\phi \approx 3.5$, indicating clear rotational support and a well-established 
thick disc. These trends point to a sharp transition in the stellar kinematics around 
$\mathrm{[M/H]} \sim -1.5$, consistent with the early onset of disc formation.

Meanwhile, the GS/E components — identifiable in the IMP, MP1, and MP2 bins — remain dynamically 
distinct, with high $|v_R|$, relatively small $v_\phi$, and negligible rotational support, reinforcing 
their origin as debris from a major radial merger \citep{Helmi2018}. Notably, given 
the estimated time of the GS/E accretion event (of order 8–11 Gyr ago \citep{Gallart2019,Belokurov2020,DiMatteo2019}),its stellar 
debris is expected to be phase-mixed. This 
implies that the positive and negative $v_R$ components should contribute approximately equally. 
This symmetry is indeed observed in the two MP bins. However, in the IMP bin the distribution is 
clearly asymmetric, with the negative $v_R$ GS/E component (aqua) containing nearly twice as many 
stars as the positive one (orange). This may suggest incomplete phase mixing or contamination by 
other structures at this intermediate metallicity.

    \label{fig:v_over_sigma}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Residual Analysis for Hidden Disc Populations}

One of the limitations of GMMs is that they can fail to detect substructures that contribute 
only weakly to the overall distribution. To address this, we perform a residual analysis to test 
whether a disc-like population—too weak to be picked up by the GMM—might nonetheless be present 
in the VMP and IMP metallicity regimes.

We generated a synthetic dataset by drawing the same number of mock stars as observed stars from 
the best-fit GMM in each bin. Since our GMM uses the Extreme Deconvolution algorithm, which accounts 
for observational uncertainties during fitting, the raw samples from the model are noise-free. 
However, comparing these directly to real data would be inappropriate due to the absence of measurement 
error. To resolve this, we assign each mock star the velocity uncertainties of its nearest neighbour 
in the observed data (in $(v_R, v_\phi, v_Z)$ space), and then add Gaussian noise according to 
these uncertainties.

We then bin both the observed and mock data in the $(v_R, v_\phi)$ plane and compute the 
normalized residual map, defined as

\[
H_{\mathrm{residual}} = \frac{H_{\mathrm{obs}} - H_{\mathrm{mock}}}{H_{\mathrm{obs}} + H_{\mathrm{mock}} + \epsilon},
\]

where $H_{\mathrm{obs}}$ and $H_{\mathrm{mock}}$ are the 2D histograms and $\epsilon = 10^{-5}$ is added 
to avoid division by zero. The residual maps are shown in the top row of Figure~\ref{fig:residuals} for 
the VMP and IMP bins. The grey dashed ellipses highlight a $2\sigma$ region of a hypothetical thick disc 
with mean velocity $(v_R, v_\phi) = (0, 180)$\,km\,s$^{-1}$ and dispersions $(\sigma_R, \sigma_\phi) 
= (70, 50)$\,km\,s$^{-1}$, consistent with the thick disc component seen in the MP2 metallicity bin.

To quantify the possible presence of a hidden disc, we count the excess number of observed stars inside 
this thick disc ellipse relative to the GMM-generated sample. We repeat this calculation for 200 Monte 
Carlo realizations to estimate the residual and its uncertainty. The results are shown as horizontal 
dashed lines in the bottom row of Figure~\ref{fig:residuals}, representing a disc-like residual 
of $40.4 \pm 24.8$ stars in the VMP bin and $76.9 \pm 42.8$ stars in the IMP bin.

To interpret these residuals, we repeat the same procedure but now inject a mock disc population—
generated from the same thick disc Gaussian—into the GMM baseline. By varying the injected disc 
fraction from 0\% to 5\% of the sample and recalculating the residual each time, we construct a 
relationship between disc fraction and expected residual. This is shown as the solid black line in the 
bottom panels of Figure~\ref{fig:residuals}, with the red shaded region indicating the $1\sigma$ 
uncertainty across Monte Carlo trials.

\section{Extension analysis}
\subsection{Alpha–element abundance}
\label{subsec:alpha}

We extend the chemo–kinematic analysis by adding the
alpha-to-iron ratio $[\alpha/\mathrm{Fe}]$, where the “alpha’’ elements
(O, Ne, Mg, Si, S, Ca, Ti) are produced almost entirely in core–collapse
(\hbox{Type II}) supernovae, whereas most iron is released later by
thermonuclear (Type Ia) explosions.  Because the two channels operate on
very different time-scales—$\sim$10–30 Myr for Type II versus
$\gtrsim$\,0.1–1 Gyr for Type Ia—the quantity $[\alpha/\mathrm{Fe}]$
encodes the star-formation history of a stellar population:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{High $[\alpha/\mathrm{Fe}]$.}  
      Rapid, intense star formation enriches gas with $\alpha$-elements 
      before significant iron production from Type Ia supernovae occurs, 
      leading to elevated $[\alpha/\mathrm{Fe}]$. This chemical signature is typical 
      of the in-situ thick disc, stellar halo, and some ancient accreted material. 
      However, at fixed metallicity, accreted populations, especially dwarf galaxies,
       tend to show lower $[\alpha/\mathrm{Fe}]$ 
      compared to in-situ stars, reflecting their slower chemical evolution.


  \item \textbf{Low $[\alpha/\mathrm{Fe}]$.}  
        A more prolonged formation history allowed Type Ia ejecta to
        accumulate, diluting the alpha enhancement.  The present-day thin
        disc and metal-rich bulge occupy this regime.
\end{itemize}

Hence the $[\alpha/\mathrm{Fe}]$–$[\mathrm{M/H}]$ plane acts as a chemical
clock: populations that overlap in $[\mathrm{M/H}]$ but differ in formation
time-scale separate cleanly in $[\alpha/\mathrm{Fe}]$.

Following \citet{Vis2024}, we separate the RGB catalogue into
high- and low-$[\alpha/{\rm M}]$ sequences using the XP abundances of
\citet{Li2024} and model each subset with an error–convolved
Gaussian–mixture as described earlier.  Before fitting the GMM,
we can expect to see some differences between the high- and low-$[\alpha/{\rm M}]$ sequences
as summarised below.  

In the high-$[\alpha/{\rm M}]$ sequence, the oldest, in-situ population formed rapidly from well-mixed,
$\alpha$-rich gas. Below $[\mathrm{M/H}]\!\approx\!-1.6$ we therefore
expect a single non-rotating halo Gaussian.  As enrichment proceeds,
gas spins up and produces the thick disc: a prograde, kinematically
warm Gaussian whose weight rises steeply between
$[\mathrm{M/H}]\!\simeq\!-1.6$ and $-1.0$ and dominates for
$[\mathrm{M/H}]>-0.7$.  Accreted debris from the last major merger
(Gaia–Sausage/Enceladus, GS/E) should not be prominent here
because GS/E stars are typically \emph{less} $\alpha$-enhanced than the
in-situ thick disc at the same metallicity
\citep[e.g.][]{Helmi2018}; our conservative
high-$[\alpha/{\rm M}]$ cut should remove most of this material.

In the low-$[\alpha/{\rm M}]$ sequence,
lower $[\alpha/{\rm M}]$ signals slower enrichment, typical of dwarf
satellites or the Milky Way disc after Type-Ia supernovae began adding
iron.  A single halo Gaussian should suffice below
$[\mathrm{M/H}]\!\approx\!-1.3$, with a cold, high-weight thin-disc
Gaussian—centred near the Local Standard of Rest and
$\sigma\!\lesssim\!30\;\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$—emerging above that
threshold.  Our footprint excludes $|b|<10^{\circ}$, however, and thus
removes most of the geometrically thin disc; the ultra-cold Gaussian
may therefore be absent at the low metalicities we are inspecting. 
 The aim is instead to pinpoint the onset
of disc-like rotation in the low-$[\alpha/{\rm M}]$ sequence despite
this selection bias.





\subsection{Data}
\label{subsec:data_vis}


We obtain the $\alpha$-to-metal abundance ratios from the
XP–based catalogue of \citet{Li2024}, whose neural-network
model, trained on high-resolution \textsc{APOGEE}~DR17
spectra, achieves a typical precision of $\simeq0.05$\,dex for
bright sources ($G<16$).  
Following \citet{Vis2024}, we cross-match the XP-based $\alpha$ catalogue 
of \citet{Li2024} with the metallicity-selected red-giant branch sample . This base sample already 
incorporates the red-giant selection and photometric quality cuts from 
\citet{Andrae2023}, including limits on surface gravity, colour–magnitude 
position, and XP calibration reliability. 

To further ensure robust $\alpha$ abundances and kinematics, we apply 
several additional cuts:
\begin{itemize}\setlength\itemsep{2pt}
  \item we reject stars within $1^\circ$ of known dwarf galaxies and 
        those associated with globular clusters;
  \item a reddening cut $E(B-V)<0.5$ removes stars in regions of high 
        extinction, where XP abundances are less reliable;
  \item a Galactic latitude cut $|b|>10^\circ$ similarly avoids 
        the dust-dominated plane;
  \item we relax the fractional parallax uncertainty cut relative to 
        Section~\ref{subsec:data_sample}, requiring only $\mathrm{fpu}<0.2$
        to retain sufficient stars in the metal-poor regime, which is 
        the focus of this analysis.
\end{itemize}


We obtain approximately 3.4 million stars in our final sample with alpha element abundances.

    \caption{Density of stars in the $[\alpha/\mathrm{M}]$–$[\mathrm{M/H}]$ plane.
             The high-$\alpha$ and low-$\alpha$ sequences are separated by the
             piece-wise linear boundary . The transition zone
             between the two sequences is clearly removed from this plot and discarded from
             subsequent analysis. (A reproduction of Figure 1 in \citet{Vis2024})}
    \label{fig:alphametal}
\end{figure}


  
Figure~\ref{fig:alphametal} displays the logarithmic density of our
RGB sample in the $[\alpha/\mathrm{M}]$–$[\mathrm{M/H}]$ plane.  Following
\citet{Chandra_2024}, but with a deliberately tighter boundary as in \citet{Vis2024}:

\[
\begin{aligned}
\text{high-}\alpha:\;&
  \begin{cases}
    [\mathrm{M/H}]<-0.60 &
      [\alpha/\mathrm{M}]>0.28\\
    -0.60\le[\mathrm{M/H}]\le0.125 &
      [\alpha/\mathrm{M}]>-0.25[\mathrm{M/H}]+0.13\\
    [\mathrm{M/H}]>0.125 &
      [\alpha/\mathrm{M}]>0.10
  \end{cases}\\[4pt]
\text{low-}\alpha:\;&
  \begin{cases}
    [\mathrm{M/H}]<-0.80 &
      [\alpha/\mathrm{M}]<0.21\\
    -0.80\le[\mathrm{M/H}]\le0.07 &
      [\alpha/\mathrm{M}]<-0.21[\mathrm{M/H}]+0.04
  \end{cases}
\end{aligned}
\]
%
and discard the intermediate “transition’’ band.

This high-$\alpha$ threshold is raised so that the
chemistry of the Gaia–Sausage/Enceladus debris
\citep{Belokurov2018,Helmi2018} does not leak into the
in-situ sequence;  
and the exclusion band is widened to maximise purity in both
sub-samples \citep{Vis2024}.  

Figure~\ref{fig:rz_metallicity} shows how metallicity varies with Galactocentric radius \(R\) and height \(z\).
The all-star map already hints at a global decline in \( [\mathrm{M/H}] \) away from the plane and the Solar circle.
This decline is more pronounced in the low-$\alpha$ sequence.

\end{figure*}

 

As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:mh_vphi_alpha}, high-$\alpha$ giants 
exhibit a gradual spin-up with increasing metallicity.  
At low metallicities ($[\mathrm{M/H}]\lesssim -2$), the population 
shows mild net prograde rotation with large dispersion, 
consistent with a dynamically hot stellar halo. From $[\mathrm{M/H}]\gtrsim -1.3$, 
there is a steady increase in rotation velocity and a corresponding decrease in 
dispersion, indicative of a transition toward the thick disc.  
By $[\mathrm{M/H}]\gtrsim -0.5$, most stars occupy a kinematic regime characterised 
by elevated $v_\phi$ and moderate dispersion, consistent with a dynamically hot 
but rotationally supported thick disc. This continuous trend supports 
a scenario in which the Galaxy’s in-situ population gradually acquired angular 
momentum as star formation progressed.


In the low-$\alpha$ panel, stars with $[\mathrm{M/H}]\lesssim -1.2$ exhibit kinematics similar 
to those in the high-$\alpha$ sequence, showing mild prograde rotation and high velocity dispersion. 
However, above $[\mathrm{M/H}]\gtrsim -1.2$, the low-$\alpha$ sequence 
undergoes a sharper transition to a population with high net prograde rotation and lower velocity dispersion. 
By $[\mathrm{M/H}]\gtrsim -0.5$, the low-$\alpha$ population exhibits kinematics consistent with the thin disc: 
a strongly rotating, dynamically cold component with lower dispersion than the high-$\alpha$ sequence.


In summary, the high-$\alpha$ sequence shows a gradual transition from
a dynamically hot halo to a thick disc, while the low-$\alpha$ sequence
shows a more abrupt transition to a dynamically cold disc at higher metallicities.



Following the method described in Section~\ref{subsec:velocities}, we obtain full six-dimensional
phase-space coordinates for the chemically separated high- and low-$\alpha$ subsamples.
Figure~\ref{fig:vr_vphi_alpha} shows the distribution of stars in the $v_R$–$v_\phi$ plane
across metallicity bins for the high-$\alpha$ (top) and low-$\alpha$ (bottom) populations.

The low-$\alpha$ sample exhibits a strong rotationally supported component, particularly at
higher metallicities ($[\mathrm{M/H}] \gtrsim -1.0$), with a narrow $v_\phi$ distribution centred
around $\sim200$ km/s and low radial velocity dispersion—clear hallmarks of thin-disc kinematics.
As metallicity decreases, this rotational component becomes less pronounced, with broader
distributions in both $v_R$ and $v_\phi$ appearing at $[\mathrm{M/H}] \lesssim -1.5$, consistent
with increased contamination from halo or accreted populations.

The high-$\alpha$ stars, by contrast, show a continuous transition from a kinematically hot,
low-rotation regime at low metallicities to a more rotation-supported disc at higher
metallicities. This reflects the gradual build-up of the thick disc over time, as also noted in
\citet{Chandra_2024}. The velocity dispersion is broader throughout,
indicating that high-$\alpha$ stars trace older, more dynamically heated populations.

           rotation-supported at high metallicities, while the high-$\alpha$ sample shows a
           broader velocity structure across all bins, consistent with thick-disc and halo populations.}

\subsection{Contrasting the high and low $\alpha$ GMMs}
\label{subsec:gmm_comparison}

The two chemical sequences trace very different roads from a dispersion–supported halo to
rotationally supported discs.

\paragraph{Very-metal-poor regime (VMP; $[\mathrm{M/H}]<-2$).}
Both data sets are best described by a \emph{single}, non–rotating halo Gaussian.
The velocity ellipsoids are close to isotropic
($\sigma_{R}\!:\!\sigma_{\phi}\!:\!\sigma_{Z}\!\approx\!1\!:\!1\!:\!1$),
with the high-$\alpha$ stars showing a slightly smaller
$\sigma_{\phi}$, hinting at an early prograde bias.
Compared to the results in Section~\ref{subsec:gmm}, where two components were
 identified in this metallicity regime, the emergence of only a single Gaussian 
 here may reflect the smaller sample size, limiting the ability of the model to 
 resolve multiple distinct halo structures.


\paragraph{Intermediate regime (IMP; $-2.0<[\mathrm{M/H}]<-1.6$).}
The low-$\alpha$ sample already splits into stationary and prograde halo
Gaussians (37\,\% vs.\ 63\,\%), whereas the high-$\alpha$ mixture needs
\textit{four} hot components, two of which have the highly radial kinematics
characteristic of Gaia–Sausage/Enceladus (GSE).
The GSE-like signal in the high-$\alpha$ branch is unexpected, as the GSE merger
originated from a dwarf galaxy with a slower star formation history and is 
therefore expected to contribute primarily $\alpha$-poor stars. 
Its appearance here likely reflects mild contamination from \mbox{[$\alpha$/M]} 
systematics at low signal-to-noise rather than a truly $\alpha$-rich GSE population.


\paragraph{Disc onset (MP1; $-1.6<[\mathrm{M/H}]<-1.3$).}
In both sequences a prograde component with a low dispersion compatible with a thick disk emerges, 
but with different prominence and kinematics.  
In the high-$\alpha$ mixture, the thick disc accounts for 31\% of the stars, rotating at 
$v_{\phi}\!\sim\!148$\,km\,s$^{-1}$, indicating the emergence of a warm, 
\textit{in-situ} rotating structure.  
The low-$\alpha$ sample is dominated by non-disc components: the stationary halo and GSE account for 72.8\% 
of the stars, while the remaining 27.2\% are captured by a thick-disc/prograde halo Gaussian with 
$v_{\phi}\!\sim\!130$\,km\,s$^{-1}$ and higher dispersions.  
This suggests that $\alpha$-rich stars settled into a disc structure earlier, while $\alpha$-poor stars at this 
metallicity remain primarily associated with accreted debris (GS/E).


\paragraph{Transition to disc dominance (MP2; $-1.3<[\mathrm{M/H}]<-1.0$).}
The high-$\alpha$ fit simplifies to three Gaussians—thick disc (52 \%),
GSE-like halo (31 \%), and a small stationary halo (17 \%).
The low-$\alpha$ solution remains complex (five Gaussians) but now
contains a substantial thick disc (25 \%) whose lower dispersion
($\sigma_{\phi}\!\sim\!48$ km s$^{-1}$) and high $v_{\phi}$ are
consistent with an early thin–disc precursor.
The ultra–cold ($\sigma\!\lesssim\!30$ km s$^{-1}$) thin disc is
\emph{absent} because our latitude/extinction cuts remove most
mid-plane stars.

  






%------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Discussion} \label{sec:discussion}

The discussion of the GMM process mirrors that of the discussion in \citet{zhang2024existencemetalpoordiscmilky}.
Since the primary goal of this report was to reproduce the results of \citet{zhang2024existencemetalpoordiscmilky},
the discussion will focus on the differences between the results of this report and those of \citet{zhang2024existencemetalpoordiscmilky}.
We do however mention the limitations of the GMM approach and selection effects - which are largely 
the same as those discussed in \citet{zhang2024existencemetalpoordiscmilky}.

\subsection{Reproducability of \citet{zhang2024existencemetalpoordiscmilky}}

The GMM decomposition presented in this report successfully reproduces the same structural features reported 
by \citet{zhang2024existencemetalpoordiscmilky} by selecting the minimum BIC score for each bin. However, there 
are several differences in our results worth highlighting.

At the very metal-poor end, our model recovers a nearly even split between stationary and prograde halo 
components, in contrast to the more dominant non-rotating halo found by \citet{zhang2024existencemetalpoordiscmilky}. 
Although the underlying stellar samples are largely the same, this discrepancy likely reflects the 
sensitivity of the GMM to initialisation and the precise kinematic distribution of stars in this 
low-metallicity regime, where substructure is subtle and overlapping. Notably, the kinematics of the 
prograde component in our fit are consistent with those reported for Aurora \citep{Belokurov2022}, 
suggesting it may correspond to an early, slightly rotating in-situ population.

In the intermediate metallicity regime ($-2.0 < \mathrm{[M/H]} < -1.6$), both studies show GSE-like 
signatures. The agreement in component structure is remarkably consistent, though our fit assigns slightly 
more weight to the GSE substructures. Interestingly, our GSE components appear with clearer symmetry in radial 
velocity, which may indicate differences in how the GMM partitions stars with highly eccentric orbits. 
The recovery of these features in both analyses suggests an ancient radial merger consistent with GS/E \citep{Belokurov2020}.

In the disc onset bin ($-1.6 < \mathrm{[M/H]} < -1.3$), we find a somewhat higher fraction of 
thick-disc stars than \citet{zhang2024existencemetalpoordiscmilky}, along with slightly lower rotational 
velocities. This could be due to small variations in how the GMM distinguishes between disc-like and 
halo-like stars in the transition regime. Despite this, both studies detect a clear emergence of a warm, 
rotating in-situ component, consistent with the kinematics of a thick disk.

By $[\mathrm{M/H}] > -1.3$, the thick disc becomes a dominant structure in our analysis and that performed
by \citet{zhang2024existencemetalpoordiscmilky}, almost surpassing the weight of the prograde halo.

In summary, while small discrepancies exist, particularly in the balance between halo and prograde components 
at low metallicity, there is an overall agreement in results.

We note that we do not attempt to reproduce the action-space analysis of \citet{zhang2024existencemetalpoordiscmilky} in this report. 
This decision reflects the fact that our analysis focuses on the use of the XD-GMM algorithm, and because of our
understanding that orbital actions do not generally follow Gaussian distributions. Unlike velocity space, which can often be 
approximated as locally Gaussian for distinct stellar populations, action space retains strong imprints 
of past dynamical processes (e.g. mergers, phase-mixing, resonances) that result in highly non-Gaussian, 
often multimodal structures.



\subsection{Expansion of \citet{Vis2024}}

We extended the XD-GMM analysis to the high and low $\alpha$ sequences identified by \citet{Vis2024}. 
Rather than assuming two Gaussian components as in \citet{Vis2024}, we fit a
Gaussian mixture model with varying numbers of components in each metallicity bin for both sequences. 
For each case, the optimal number of components was selected based on the minimum BIC score.
This allows us to capture the full complexity of the kinematic structure in both sequences,
including the presence of multiple halo components and the emergence of thick disc structures 
at different metallicities.

We were successfully able to reproduce the figures and data preparation described in \citet{Vis2024}, as shown in the plots of 
Section~\ref{subsec:data_vis}.

As outlined in Section~\ref{subsec:alpha}, we expected structural differences between the high- and low-$\alpha$ sequences 
to emerge in the GMM fits. These expectations were largely met: the high-$\alpha$ stars exhibited a clear transition 
towards a rotationally supported disc at earlier metallicities, while the low-$\alpha$ stars remained halo-dominated 
until higher metallicities.

One of the more unexpected outcomes of this analysis is the identification of GS/E components within the 
high-$\alpha$ sequence, despite the GS/E progenitor being associated with a slow star formation 
history that should result in an $\alpha$-poor population. This is likely due to contamination from 
low signal-to-noise abundance measurements, or challenges in separating overlapping kinematic substructures 
when using GMMs. In future work, it would be helpful to consider how abundance uncertainties, particularly at low 
metallicities, may affect the classification of stars. Additionally, as seen in Figure~\ref{fig:alphametal}, 
there appears to be a number of low-$\alpha$ stars at $[\mathrm{M/H}]\sim-2.5$ with 
[$\alpha$/M]~$\sim$~0.1. It remains unclear whether this population is real or the result of measurement 
uncertainties, and it would benefit from further investigation.


\subsection{Selection Effects and} \label{subsec:selection_effects}

This part of the discussion closely follows the treatment of selection effects in 
\citet{zhang2024existencemetalpoordiscmilky}. As in their study, our application of quality cuts, such 
as removing stars with high extinction or low Galactic latitude, and enforcing a strict parallax quality 
threshold, introduces a non-trivial selection function that affects the relative detectability of 
different Galactic components.

In particular, the Galactic latitude cut removes many stars near the disc midplane, where the 
low-$\alpha$ thin disc is most prominent. While relaxing this cut does lead to the identification of a
colder, low-dispersion disc component in the low-$\alpha$ sequence at higher metallicities, this 
component is not considered in our analysis. Our focus is on characterising the onset of disc like 
kinematics across metallicity in both chemical sequences, rather than describing the well established 
thin disc. Including low latitude stars would bias the sample toward the disc population, introduce 
uncertainties in the metallicity estimates, since Gaia XP abundances are known to be less reliable in 
egions of high extinction, and obscure the halo to disc transition that is central to this investigation.


It is important to note that the component weights derived in this work reflect the properties of our 
selected sample and should not be generalised to the full Galaxy without modelling the underlying 
selection function.


\subsection{Limitations of GMM}

Although this part of the discussion mirrors that of \citet{zhang2024existencemetalpoordiscmilky}, 
it is worth reiterating that the Gaussian mixture model approach has several limitations. 
By construction, Gaussian mixtures impose symmetric, ellipsoidal structures in velocity space, 
which is an oversimplification of the true distribution function of Galactic populations. 
For instance, the velocity distribution of the thin disc is known to be strongly non Gaussian 
due to features such as asymmetric drift, while the GS/E debris has been shown to display bimodal 
structure in the radial velocity component \citep{Lancaster2019}. 
In addition, resonant interactions with the Galactic bar may introduce asymmetric and non Gaussian 
features in the velocity distributions \citep[e.g.][]{Dillamore2023}. 

We therefore restrict our unconstrained GMM analysis to the range $-3 < \mathrm{[M/H]} < -1$, 
where the thin disc contribution is minimal. At higher metallicities, the GMM attempts to describe 
the sharp kinematic features of the thin disc using multiple Gaussians, which are not physically 
meaningful. While more flexible models based on physically motivated distribution functions 
could better capture these complexities \citep[e.g.][]{Binney2010}, they require significantly more 
computational effort and are beyond the scope of this report.

Another known limitation of GMMs is their reduced sensitivity to small subpopulations. 
We find little evidence for a significant disc like component at low metallicities, but 
this absence should be interpreted with caution. By freezing a disc like component and re running 
the GMM, we confirm that any such population, if present, contributes only a small fraction 
of the total. 

Lastly, while we remove stars near known satellites and apply strict quality cuts that reduce 
the impact of unmixed debris, it remains possible that residual substructure affects the fitting. 
The tilt observed in the prograde halo component at low metallicities may reflect such a substructure, 
and the asymmetric weighting of GS/E components in the IMP bin could be related.
